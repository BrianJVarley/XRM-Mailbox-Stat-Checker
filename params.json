It also checks the following details:\r\n\r\n◙The mailbox email address is correct.\r\n◙The connection to the email server is working.\r\n◙You have the right privileges to access the mailbox.\r\n\r\nLuckily I’ve created a tool to do just that for queue and user’s email addresses. \r\n\r\nNote that to do either of these configuration changes you need to be signed into the tool as a System Admin or the owner of the mailbox.\r\n\r\nAfter approving or enabling the email using the tool, resend the email in CRM wait 10 minutes for the email router to process the email. Then check the status of the pending send email. You should now see either a status of “sending” or “sent”.\r\n\r\n\r\n### User Guide\r\n\r\n![](http://brianvarley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://brianvarley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/33.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](http://brianvarley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter enabling or approving the email - resend the email in Dynamics and check the send status which should now be sent or sending:\r\n\r\n![](http://brianvarley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.png)\r\n\r\n### Dynamics Email Traffic Flow\r\n\r\n![Dynamics Email Traffic Flow](http://brianvarley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/8424.1.png-550x0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTool Developer - @BrianJVarley \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this tool?
